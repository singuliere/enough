SSH public keys
===============

Each :doc:`team <team>` member with access to the infrastructure
should have their ssh public key in `the ssh_keys directory
<http://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/tree/master/molecule/authorized_keys/roles/authorized_keys/files/ssh_keys>`_ so it is added to the `~debian/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
