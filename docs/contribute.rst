Contribute

Organization
------------

All contributors are organized horizontally (i.e. there is no
organization or structure) and are expected to follow these rules:

* An action that has no impact on others can be carried out without
  asking for permission
* An action impacting others is advertised in advance and carried out
  if there is a consensus
* Any person impacted by an action can call for a vote
* People with access to an exclusive resource must register themselves
  in the :doc:`team directory <team>`
