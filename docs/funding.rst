Funding
=======

Introduction
------------

Funding sources are to be defined

Advertisement and call for proposals
------------------------------------

#. The total amount of money in the `Enough Community` fund is announced every other month in the `in the forum
   <https://forum.enough.community/c/funding>`__.
#. The announcement must include a call for ideas to spend the fund. This is less formal that a request and encourages participation from people who are not active volunteers. It is made clear the volunteers are not expected to followup to avoid any kind of disapointment.
#. After two weeks the thread is summarized by a member :doc:`funding team <team>` and closed.

Workflow
--------

All expenses are proposed and approved as follows:

#. Someone posts a message `in the forum
   <https://forum.enough.community/c/funding>`__ asking for funds to be released.
#. The request is discussed by active volunteers. A volunteer is an
   individual who does not receive any monetary compensation, either
   directly or indirectly for the work done on Enough. A volunteer
   is active if they contributed in a quantifiable way to Enough
   in the past six months.
#. Ideally there is a consensus between the volunteers. If at least
   one volunteer asks for a vote, it is organized in the form of a yes
   or no question. The winner of the vote is the one that gets the
   most votes.
#. After at least a week, a member of the :doc:`funding team <team>`
   reviews the thread and either:

   * releases the funds as instructed if there are no objections or a
     vote decides in favor and adds a message to the thread; or
   * clearly explains why the funds cannot be released and what needs to be
     done before they can be released.

#. The thread is closed.
