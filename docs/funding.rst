Funding
=======

Introduction
------------

Funding is `collected via Liberapay <https://liberapay.com/>`__ by the `SecureDrop team <https://liberapay.com/SecureDrop>`__. The `SecureDropCommunity user <https://liberapay.com/SecureDropCommunity>`__ is controlled by the people from the :doc:`funding team <team>`, via the admin@securedrop.club email. All expenses are proposed and approved as follows:

Workflow
--------

#. Someone posts a message `in the forum
   <https://forum.securedrop.club/c/funding>`__ asking for funds to be released.
#. The request is discussed by active volunteers. A volunteer is an
   individual who does not receive any monetary compensation, either
   directly or indirectly for the work done on SecureDrop. A volunteer
   is active if they contributed in a quantifiable way to SecureDrop
   in the past six months.
#. Ideally there is a consensus between the volunteers. If at least
   one volunteer asks for a vote, it is organized in the form of a yes
   or no question. The winner of the vote is the one that gets the
   most votes.
#. After at least a week, a member of the :doc:`funding team <team>`
   reviews the thread and either:

   * releases the funds as instructed if there are no objections or a
     vote decides in favor and adds a message to the thread; or
   * clearly explains why the funds cannot be released and what needs to be
     done before they can be released.

#. The thread is closed.

Freedom of the Press Foundation
-------------------------------

The `Freedom of the Press Foundation <https://freedom.press>`__ also runs a `SecureDrop fundraiser <https://freedom.press/crowdfunding/securedrop/>`__ and decides how the collected funds are spent.
