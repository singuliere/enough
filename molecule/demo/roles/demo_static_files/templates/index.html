It's been modified to run on a normal HTTPS website rather than Tor Hidden Services, which is not recommended for real instances in production.</p>
	  <p><strong><font color="#FF0000">WARNING: Do NOT submit any news tips or leaks here. This is a sample SecureDrop for demonstration purposes only.</font><strong></strong></strong></p>
	  <p>SecureDrop consists of two interfaces: one for meant for sources, and another for journalists. Here are the links:</p>
		<h3><a href="http://source.demo.{{ domain }}">Source Interface</a></h3>
		<h3><a href="http://journalist.demo.{{ domain }}">Journalist Interface</a></h3>
	  <p>A login is needed to access the Document Interface. Here are the credentials:</p>
	  <p><strong>Username:</strong> journalist<br><strong>Password:</strong> WEjwn8ZyczDhQSK24YKM8C9a</p>
	  <p>You'll also need to scan the following QR code with the <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> smartphone app in order to generate the 6-digit codes needed for logging in.<br><img src="qr.png"><br><strong>Two-factor Code:</strong> jhco go7v cer3 ej4l</p>
	  <p>Finally, all submissions are encrypted with a GPG private key, which you can download <a href="test_journalist_key.sec">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>If you run into a problem with the demo or need to discuss more about what it does, please <a href="https://forum.securedrop.club/c/securedrop-demo">write a message in the forum</a>.</p>
